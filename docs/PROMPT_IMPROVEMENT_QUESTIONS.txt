Prompt Improvement Questions - For Review

1. Document Type & Role Description
- Prompt currently says "Master Service Agreement" but we now handle NDAs too
- Should we update to: "Master Service Agreement or Non-Disclosure Agreement" or keep generic?

2. Organization Name vs Party A/Party B
- What is "Organization Name" relative to Party A/Party B?
- Is it the same entity or different? Need clarification for extraction guidance.

3. Document Type Edge Cases
- What if document is both MSA and NDA?
- What if unclear (e.g., just "Services Agreement")?

4. Termination Notice Period Format
- Should we enforce exact format: "30 days" (not "thirty days" or "30-day")?
- Handle "calendar days" vs "business days"?
- Normalize units (e.g., "1 month" = "30 days")?

5. Contract Value Format
- Always include decimals (e.g., "50000.00") or allow "50000"?
- How to handle currency symbols (e.g., "$50,000" → "50000.00")?
- Keep currency separate from value?

6. Currency Field
- List all supported currencies or keep open?
- What if currency not mentioned - infer or "Not Found"?

7. Pricing Model Type
- What if hybrid model (e.g., fixed base + hourly)? Pick primary?
- Normalize "Time and Materials" to "T&M"?

8. Force Majeure Special Case
- Only clause that explicitly returns "Not Found" if absent - keep this special or make consistent?

9. Search Guidance Organization
- Reorganize by logical groups (Document-level, Party info, Dates, Commercial, Legal)?

10. Prompt Length
- Keep comprehensive or split into clearer sections?

Priority: Medium - Current prompt works, but these clarifications will improve extraction accuracy.
